Drag and Drop Plan

Panel one Elements need to have a dnd listener implemented in them
	Will just use a parent DraggableLabel class and make the elements a subclass.
	One place to fix things.

I don't think data actualy needs to be transfered except for which label was dragged

It might be better to keep the labels as classes instead of pictures for data and interaction purposes.


Panel two will also become a child class of a draghandler class where it extends jpanel


DRaggableLabel doesnt need uinque child classes.
